# ✈️ Flight Booking Simulator (FastAPI + Streamlit + SQLite)

Flight Booking Simulator with Dynamic Pricing
Project Overview
This project is a web-based Flight Booking Simulator that mimics real-world airline reservation systems, featuring a dynamic pricing engine. It allows users to search flights, view fares that adjust dynamically based on time remaining, seat availability, and simulated demand, and complete a multi-step booking process. The system includes a robust backend for managing pricing algorithms, seat inventory, and concurrent bookings, paired with a responsive frontend interface.

Features
Flight search with filters such as origin, destination, date, price, and duration

Dynamic pricing algorithm adjusting fares in real-time based on demand and seat availability

Full booking workflow including seat selection, passenger details, payment simulation, and booking confirmation with PNR generation

Concurrency-safe transactional management to ensure seat availability accuracy

Booking cancellation and retrieval of booking history

Frontend UI with integration of backend APIs and downloadable booking receipts

Installation and Setup
Set up a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) and populate it with simulated flight data.

Install backend dependencies using your preferred Python package manager.

Run the backend API server built with Flask or FastAPI.

Launch the frontend UI built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React.

Access the application via a web browser to search, book, and manage flights.

Usage
Search flights by specifying origin, destination, and travel dates.

View dynamically updated fares reflecting current simulated demand.

Proceed through a multi-step booking process to reserve seats and input passenger information.

Receive a booking confirmation with unique PNR and option to download receipts.

Manage existing bookings including cancellations and history review.

Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with full-stack development integrating frontend, backend, and database layers

Implementation of dynamic pricing algorithms simulating real-world airline behavior

Mastery of concurrency control in transactional booking workflows

Development of RESTful APIs and frontend-backend integration
